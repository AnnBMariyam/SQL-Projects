# 🏥 Hospital Analytics — Project Overview

## 🎯 Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital operations using SQL, focusing on:
- patient demographics and disease trends  
- doctor workload and performance  
- departmental efficiency  
- appointment patterns  
- revenue and billing insights  

This project simulates how a data analyst supports hospital management by providing insights that help improve patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.
