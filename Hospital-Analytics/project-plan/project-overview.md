#  Hospital Analytics — Project Overview

##  Project Purpose
The goal of this project is to analyze hospital operations using SQL, focusing on:
- patient demographics and disease trends  
- doctor workload and performance  
- departmental efficiency  
- appointment patterns  
- revenue and billing insights  

This project simulates how a data analyst supports hospital management by providing insights that help improve patient care, resource allocation, and operational efficiency.

##  Dataset Summary
This project uses **six relational tables** representing one year of hospital activity:

### • patients  
Contains patient demographic details, disease information, and admission/discharge dates.

### • doctors  
Stores doctor information such as specialization, experience, and department assignment.

### • departments  
Lists hospital departments and their locations.

### • appointments  
Tracks patient appointments with doctors and appointment status (Completed, Cancelled, No-show).

### • billing  
Contains billing and payment information for patients.

### • medical_records
