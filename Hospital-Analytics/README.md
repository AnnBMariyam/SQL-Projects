# Hospital Patient Analytics (SQL Project)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes hospital operations using SQL to uncover insights related to:
- patient demographics and disease trends
- doctor workload and department activity
- appointment behavior
- billing and revenue patterns

The goal is to simulate how a data analyst supports healthcare decision-making using structured data.

## Dataset Description
This project uses six relational datasets:

- **patients** – patient demographics, disease, admission details  
- **doctors** – doctor specialization and department assignment  
- **departments** – hospital department information  
- **appointments** – appointment scheduling and status  
- **billing** – payment amounts and methods  
- **medical_records** – diagnosis, treatment, and cost details

## SQL Skills Demonstrated
- SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY
- INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN
- GROUP BY, HAVING
- Aggregation functions (SUM, AVG, COUNT)
- Window functions (DENSE_RANK)
- Subqueries and real-world analytics logic
